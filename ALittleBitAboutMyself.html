                <span style = "color:red;">Ernesto Moleno</span>, I am nineteen years old and I am currently a computer science major at Cal Poly Pomona. 
                My favorite movie would be Avengers Endgame.
                My favorite hobby is working out. 
                I have never reread a book series, but if I had to choose I would love to reread the Percy Jackson series.
